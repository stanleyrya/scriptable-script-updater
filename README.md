# scriptable-universal-widget

### Original Inspiration:
https://gitlab.com/sillium-scriptable-projects/universal-scriptable-widget/-/tree/master

### How it works

1. Copy the widget code into your Scriptable app.
2. Configure the library to be used.
3. Make sure the name of your script tells you what library you are using so it's easy to remember which one it is.
3. Run it!

### Why not make this script/widget dynamic?

While it's pretty easy to edit this script to take in the widget URL as a parameter I personally think it would be annoying. Here's my reasoning:
1. If your homescreen gets messed up it's pretty annoying to copy-paste all of the github URLs again.
2. If you are using parameters for your widget it's annoying to configure with the github URLs (the text box is pretty small).

If you'd like to parameterize it though, feel free! :)
